# 👋 Welcome

This repository documents my Python journey — a collection of small projects I’ve created as I learn and grow.

I began Python in **May 2025** after being selected for *Code in Place by Stanford University* 🎓. Since then, I’ve been building small programs to strengthen my skills and solidify core concepts. 🧠🐍
